## Author

{{< person url="https://github.com/Jawabiscuit" name="Jonas Avrin" nick="javrin" text="Creator of this website" picture="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/219464?v=4" >}}
 | [CV](https://drive.proton.me/urls/V11RMFQ8R8#aMGnkOHP8fwY) | Residence: [Connecticut, USA](https://www.google.com/maps/@41.4258218,-73.483079,13z)

Welcome! I'm a Pipeline Technical Director by trade with experience working in the Animation/VFX/Games industries. For an overview, cruise on over to my [LinkedIn] profile or take a look at my CV linked above.

With over 15 years of professional experience, I've transitioned from artist roles such as Animator and Character TD to technical roles such as Technical Director solving complex challenges and developing sophisticated workflows for AAA games, commercials, and movies. In technical roles, I've contributed my engineering expertise to developing animation tools and pipelines for iconic animated and live action cinematic productions. For a (mostly) complete list of projects, check out [imdb].

As an active contributor on GitHub, I believe strongly in free (libre) and open-source development and have contributed to open source including `rez`, an incubation project under the Academy Software Foundation.

Currently, I'm captivated by the potential of real-time pipelines utilizing game engines like Unreal for various mediums, from games to virtual production. I am equally motivated to harness the power of machine learning and AI as capable tools for realizing humanity's most ambitious ideas.
