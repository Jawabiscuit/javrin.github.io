# Maya

Videos of projects I've made using Autodesk Maya.

&nbsp;

## Character TD Demo

Kaylee is a cartoon-style character I rigged from start to finish. Her face rig has a high level of fidelity for being only a joint driven rig--we were on a tight time budget and I did all the work pro bono while being employed full time. She was animated in a few previs sequences in the short-film [Hephaestus](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/awtcurtis/hephaestus-short-film/posts) before the project came to abrupt halt, and many of us were whisked away by our careers in the industry. --RIP Doug

{{< admonition type=note open=true >}}
The demo shows Kaylee moving around in her optimized (except the face) anim mesh. She's also skinned to a high res render mesh.
