## Unreal
Videos of projects I've made using Unreal Engine.

{{< admonition type=note open=true >}}
These demo projects are not polished, except for the main features that were focused on. They aren't meant to be masterpieces in their own right, just do a few things really well.

## Maya
Videos of projects I've made using Autodesk Maya.
### Character TD Demo
Kaylee is a cartoon-style character I rigged from start to finish. Her face rig has a high level of fidelity for being only a joint driven rig--we were on a tight time budget and I did all the work pro bono while being employed full time. She was animated in a few previs sequences in the short-film [Hephaestus](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/awtcurtis/hephaestus-short-film/posts) before the project tragically came to an end, but many of us were wisked away by our careers in the industry as well. --RIP Doug

The demo shows Kaylee moving around in her optimized anim mesh--except the face. She's also skinned to a high res render mesh.

### Technical Animation / TD Show Reel

{{< admonition type=note open=true >}}
This is an old demo I made before I went to work at BlueSky studios where I worked on many animated films before the studio was shut down. Please visit my [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4065755/) to see those projects.
