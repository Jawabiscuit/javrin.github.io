Pages CMS is a new alternative CMS for static websites hosted on GitHub with others coming soon. Getting started is easy with the online version and you can self-host on cloudflare. I've been investigating solutions for CMS but haven't jump into anything yet, only using Obsidian as a local CMS solution which I thought I'd like but I feel like the experience is not efficient, preventing me from getting into the habit of blogging and updating my Hugo website.
