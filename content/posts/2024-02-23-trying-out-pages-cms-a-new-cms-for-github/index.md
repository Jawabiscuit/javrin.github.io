I've been investigating solutions for [CMS] but haven't jumped into anything, until today, and who can blame me with the number of solutions sprouting up daily (it seems). There's [decapcms] which I've known about since day 1, the gran-daddy you might say.

| cms           | distinction                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| [decapcms]    | Previously Netlify                     |
| [staticcms]   | Fork of Decap focused on core features |
| [sveltia-cms] | Decap's backend with a prettier skin   |
| [statamic]    | Full-stack SSG and CMS                 |

I'm currently using Obsidian as a local CMS solution which is more than capable but I feel the content creation process could be more efficient and accessible from more devices. The latter is also possible with Obsidian but the setup would be very involved. The goal I set for myself for the beginning of 2024 is getting into a consistent habit of blogging and updating my Hugo website. I'm constantly in awe at individuals, presumably busier than I, that can keep up with a blog or any kind of content creation!

Yesterday I found out about a NKOTB, [Pages CMS], a new alternative CMS for static websites hosted on GitHub with other SCM platforms coming soon. Getting started is free and easy with the online version and you can self-host on Cloudflare. There are various solutions out there, but I'm looking for a tool that's free, accessible online with a clean, easy to use UI/UX/DX and Pages seems to fit that bill. I'm a team of one, so I'm not as concerned about the aspects of Pages that facilitate team collaboration but it definitely lends itself well to that end, with its robust configuration feature.

Pages aims to be a CMS that's compatible with a variety of [SSGs], Hugo being just one of them. While there are intricacies of Hugo that might need to be addressed, I've tried it out and I'm surprised at how flexible it is, being able to handle a flat or collection (bundles in Hugo) structure. I'm able to use it presently to draft posts online from any device and polish them off with Obsidian, mostly because of the frontmatter metadata and the theme I'm using, but I'm sure that will change very soon.

I won't be letting go of Obsidian any time soon, on the contrary I'll be molding the configuration to better suit the task, and hopefully be sharing the progress here so stay tuned! What's your favorite tool for content management? Are you a solo developer? I'd be interested to know!
