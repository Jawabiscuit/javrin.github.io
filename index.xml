The video is mostly me noodling around in Cascadeur which I&amp;rsquo;ve been evaluating for character animation then applying the cleaned animation into the game and finally testing it along with the other fun new features I added.
About the Character The character model and rig I&amp;rsquo;m working with is from the Shadow Fight Arena 4 game, which I have zero experience with playing, provided by the talented team at Cascadeur on Renderhub.</description></item><item><title>Trying Out Pages CMS - A New CMS for GitHub</title><link>https://javrin.github.io/posts/2024-02-23-trying-out-pages-cms-a-new-cms-for-github/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 13:30:42 -0500</pubDate><author>Jonas Avrin</author><guid>https://javrin.github.io/posts/2024-02-23-trying-out-pages-cms-a-new-cms-for-github/</guid><description><![CDATA[I&rsquo;ve been investigating solutions for CMS but haven&rsquo;t jumped into anything, until today, and who can blame me with the number of solutions sprouting up daily it seems.

ðŸ‘‹ Hello Hugo This is my new site generated using Hugo!
Ahhhh â˜º &amp;ndash; a fresh start. A new chapter is beginning, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eye on Hugo for a while. Having started and abandoned SSG (static site generator) projects in the past, this might be thee one for a while. It feels stable, feature rich, and easy to work with&amp;ndash;all characteristics that are crucial for consistently keeping up and growing a website.</description></item></channel></rss>
