Superhero Flight Mechanics Yep, if you&rsquo;ve been paying attention, superhero flight gameplay has been trending lately and while I&rsquo;m not making a game in the Marvel universe any time soon, it&rsquo;s actually quite fun and relaxing to play with and it would definitely come in handy as a, somewhat OP, &ldquo;god mode&rdquo; for any game.]]></description></item><item><title>Tame Multiple Obsidian Vaults With This Plugin Sync Hack</title><link>https://javrin.github.io/posts/2024-04-20-tame-multiple-obsidian-vaults-with-this-plugin-sync-hack/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2024 10:57:56 -0400</pubDate><author>Jonas Avrin</author><guid>https://javrin.github.io/posts/2024-04-20-tame-multiple-obsidian-vaults-with-this-plugin-sync-hack/</guid><description><![CDATA[If you&rsquo;re like me and you&rsquo;ve tried to maintain multiple Obsidian vaults, odds are you&rsquo;ve encountered the same headache of having to sync plugins and settings which usually takes you out of the flow. You also might be thinking to yourself, why haven&rsquo;t I done something about this yet, I mean, I love hacking in the terminal don&rsquo;t I?
I separate vaults based on a variety of reasons, but a common reason would be to separate your public and private notes.]]></description></item><item><title>UE5 Game Dev Log</title><link>https://javrin.github.io/posts/2024-04-18-ue5-game-dev-log/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 19:41:31 -0400</pubDate><author>Jonas Avrin</author><guid>https://javrin.github.io/posts/2024-04-18-ue5-game-dev-log/</guid><description>UE5 Game Dev Log Today&amp;rsquo;s development sessions were about creating a dash roll mechanic for the character and re-animating bits of her locomotion animation in Cascadeur after the retargeting from UE5 mannequin. The video is mostly me noodling around in Cascadeur which I&amp;rsquo;ve been evaluating for character animation then applying the cleaned animation into the game and finally testing it along with the other fun new features I added.
About the Character The character model and rig I&amp;rsquo;m working with is from the Shadow Fight Arena 4 game, which I have zero experience with playing, provided by the talented team at Cascadeur on Renderhub.</description></item><item><title>Trying Out Pages CMS - A New CMS for GitHub</title><link>https://javrin.github.io/posts/2024-02-23-trying-out-pages-cms-a-new-cms-for-github/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 13:30:42 -0500</pubDate><author>Jonas Avrin</author><guid>https://javrin.github.io/posts/2024-02-23-trying-out-pages-cms-a-new-cms-for-github/</guid><description><![CDATA[I&rsquo;ve been investigating solutions for CMS but haven&rsquo;t jumped into anything, until today, and who can blame me with the number of solutions sprouting up daily it seems.

ðŸ‘‹ Hello Hugo This is my new site generated using Hugo!
Ahhhh â˜º &amp;ndash; a fresh start. A new chapter is beginning, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eye on Hugo for a while. Having started and abandoned SSG (static site generator) projects in the past, this might be thee one for a while. It feels stable, feature rich, and easy to work with&amp;ndash;all characteristics that are crucial for consistently keeping up and growing a website.</description></item></channel></rss>
