[{"categories":["Productivity"],"content":" If you’re like me and you’ve tried to maintain multiple Obsidian vaults, odds are you’ve encountered the same headache of having to sync plugins and settings which usually takes you out of the flow. You also might be thinking to yourself, why haven’t I done something about this yet, I mean, I love hacking in the terminal don’t I? I separate vaults based on a variety of reasons, but a common reason would be to separate your public and private notes. This is beneficial for organization, but creates more busy work if you like keeping your plugins and settings in sync. Now that my vault count has now grown beyond 3, I finally broke down and scripted the synchronization process for multiple vaults. Whether you juggle personal and work vaults or maintain multiple knowledge bases, these snippets are must-have productivity hacks. Spice Rating: 🌶🌶🌶 - This guide covers using bash scripts to synchronize Obsidian plugin settings across multiple vaults. Familiarity with Obsidian’s plugin folder structure and prior experience using bash terminals is assumed. Running code from the internet can be destructive so always test and make backups of your files before hand! Also note I’m writing this on a Windows machine but should work for any platform since you can run bash on all of them. Why don’t I use git? I do, but I don’t like tracking plugin settings which could have sensitive information like API keys 😱! Sync Obsidian Plugin Settings (single vault) If you haven’t been scared away, I will briefly break down how the first simple one-liner works. There are 2 versions of each snippet, dry run and execute, for both single and multi-vault variants. You’ll want to use the single vault variant if the number of vaults you have is currently manageable or feel more comfortable running just one line of code. The “Dry Run” command uses the find utility to locate all data.json files within the .obsidian/plugins/ directory of your current vault. Note that you’ll need to cd to your current vault first. This is where Obsidian stores plugin settings and data. The -print option just prints the full paths of the matched files to the console, allowing you to preview what would be copied without actually copying anything yet. The “Execute” command is similar, but instead of just printing the paths, it uses the -exec option to run the cp command on each matched file. This copies the data.json file to the /p/obsidian/personal-notes/ directory while preserving the same nested folder structure under .obsidian/plugins/. So in effect, running this second command line will sync all your current vault’s plugin settings over to a second vault located at /p/obsidian/personal-notes/. Dry Run (print only) find .obsidian/plugins/ -type f -name data.json -print Execute (copy) find .obsidian/plugins/ -type f -name data.json -exec cp {} /p/obsidian/personal-notes/{} \\; Sync Obsidian Plugin Settings (multiple vaults) This variant extends previous single vault script to handle multiple destinations. Similar to the single vault variant, the “Dry Run” version of the script just prints out the cp operations it would perform without actually copying anything. This lets you validate the output before executing the real copy. Dry run (print only) find .obsidian/plugins/ -type f -name data.json -exec sh -c ' src=\"$1\" dir=$(dirname \"$src\") for dest in /p/obsidian/business-vault /p/obsidian/personal-notes /p/obsidian/mysite.github.io /p/obsidian/obsidian-notes; do echo cp -uv \"$src\" \"$dest/$dir\" done' _ {} \\; Execute (copy) find .obsidian/plugins/ -type f -name data.json -exec sh -c ' src=\"$1\" dir=$(dirname \"$src\") for dest in /p/obsidian/business-vault /p/obsidian/personal-notes /p/obsidian/javrin.github.io /p/obsidian/obsidian-notes; do cp -uv \"$src\" \"$dest/$dir\" done' _ {} \\; Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening: find is used again to locate all data.json files in the current vault’s .obsidian/plugins/ folder. For each match, it runs the code in the -exec sh -c block, passing the f","date":"2024-04-20","objectID":"/posts/2024-04-20-tame-multiple-obsidian-vaults-with-this-plugin-sync-hack/:0:0","tags":["obsidian","bash","snippet"],"title":"Tame Multiple Obsidian Vaults With This Plugin Sync Hack","uri":"/posts/2024-04-20-tame-multiple-obsidian-vaults-with-this-plugin-sync-hack/"},{"categories":["Dev"],"content":"UE5 Game Dev Log Today’s development sessions were about creating a dash roll mechanic for the character and re-animating bits of her locomotion animation in Cascadeur after the retargeting from UE5 mannequin.

I chose her for the accessories she has to animate. It’s a decent character, but the rig definitely isn’t the cleanest. She’s functional but not reusable so the goal is to eventually rebuild her into a more polished portfolio piece. This process is testing my knowledge of many aspects of character development and if it’s possible I’d also like to share the final rig. The rig was prepared in Maya for Chaos cloth and physics simulations, ensuring that it can achieve realistic cloth dynamics within UE5. For this character, I’ve simulated the chest, earrings, and the back of the bandana, adding an extra layer of realism and movement to the overall look.

The player is able to perform a dash roll using the controller or get launched by overlapping with the actor placed in the world. This is achieved using some vector multiplication combined with “Launch Character” function and a rolling animation montage, and allows our character to perform a lightning-fast dash or roll, adding an exciting yet over-powered dodge/movement ability to the gameplay. It will need to be fine-tuned but it’s fun for the time being. Animation Retargeting and Refinement I successfully retargeted the UE Mannequin animations over to the custom character rig, but the retargeted animations are, as usual, only a good starting point for gross character movements as they aren’t very appealing. So I took the time to start reanimating the locomotion beginning with idle and walk-in-place animations. Next, I will tackle the walk and run motions. Cascadeur is making quick work out of this process. I had only intended to clean up the retargeted motion however I ended up throwing most of the original animation out and taking a few key poses and sprucing them up here and there. Even so, with the help of Cascadeur’s smart autoposing rig and unbake animation tool, I was able to make quick work of it. Overall, it was a productive day filled with promising advancements in character animation and movement mechanics. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to tweak and add more to this character in Unreal Engine 5.

The latter is also possible with Obsidian but the setup would be very involved. The goal I set for myself for the beginning of 2024 is getting into a consistent habit of blogging and updating my Hugo website. I’m constantly in awe at individuals, presumably busier than I, that can keep up with a blog or any kind of content creation! Yesterday I found out about a NKOTB, Pages CMS, a new alternative CMS for static websites hosted on GitHub with other SCM platforms coming soon. Getting started is free and easy with the online version and you can self-host on Cloudflare. There are various solutions out there, but I’m looking for a tool that’s free, accessible online with a clean, easy to use UI/UX/DX and Pages seems to fit that bill. I’m a team of one, so I’m not as concerned about the aspects of Pages that facilitate collaboration but it definitely lends itself well to that end, with its robust configuration feature and online editing. Pages aims to be a CMS that’s compatible with a variety of SSGs, Hugo being just one of them. While there are intricacies of Hugo that might need to be addressed, I’ve tried it out and I’m surprised at how flexible it is, being able to handle a flat or collection (bundles in Hugo) file structures. I’m able to use it presently to draft posts online from any device and polish them off in Obsidian, but I’d like to publish, at least short “TIL” posts, from the web. I won’t be letting go of Obsidian any time soon, on the contrary I’ll be molding the configuration to better suit the task, and hopefully be sharing the progress here so stay tuned! What’s your favorite tool for content management? Are you a solo developer? I’d be interested to know!

Ahhhh ☺ – a fresh start. A new chapter is beginning, and I’ve had my eye on Hugo for a while. Having started and abandoned SSG (static site generator) projects in the past, this might be thee one for a while. It feels stable, feature rich, and easy to work with–all characteristics that are crucial for consistently keeping up and growing a website. If you’re looking for an SSG, the most popular ones seem to be: Jekyll - Ruby based static site generator. Hugo - Go based static site generator. Gatsby - React based framework for building websites and apps. In this post I’d like to briefly share insights from my comparative analysis of SSGs and explain why I chose Hugo over Jekyll or Gatsby this time around.

On top of that, no more running gem as well as bundle commands, and keeping up with dependencies is much less of a hassle to non-existent as of yet. So far, I’m really impressed with local preview builds, how fast and responsive they are, and visually the site is an exact match locally as it is deployed. Finally, the project directory feels less cluttered (and you know what they say about cleanliness). Every body likes lists, so here’s my top 10 reasons for using Hugo in no particular order: Stability Features Ease-of-use Robust and easy to use command line Dependency management Clean project structure Performance Speedy preview builds Rapid deployment It’s free!
